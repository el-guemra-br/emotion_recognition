# Real-Time Facial Emotion Recognition
## Project Description: 

- This application performs real-time facial emotion recognition using your webcam. It leverages deep learning and computer vision to analyze facial expressions, predicting emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more. The project uses the fer Python library, which provides a pre-trained model for accurate and efficient emotion detection.

## Features
- Detects and classifies emotions from live video feed.

- Annotates detected faces with predicted emotions and confidence scores.

- Fast and efficient thanks to pre-trained deep learning models.

## Installation
- Clone this repository:

      git clone https://github.com/your-username/EmotionRecognition.git
      cd EmotionRecognition

## Install dependencies:

     pip install -r requirements.txt

   - The main requirements are: opencv-python, fer.

## Usage
- Run the script:

      python emotion_recognition.py

- Allow webcam access when prompted.

- Detected faces and emotions will display live in the application window.

- Press q to exit the program.

## Customization
- To use other emotion recognition models or datasets, modify the code to load your preferred models.

- The application can be further extended to save results, process images in bulk, or log statistics for each emotion.
